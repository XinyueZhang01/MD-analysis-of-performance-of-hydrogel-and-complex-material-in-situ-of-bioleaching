# MD-analysis-of-performance-of-hydrogel-and-complex-material-in-situ-of-bioleaching
A multiscale digital twin of the bioleaching system. This includes simulating molecular interactions between hydrogels and metal ions (using GROMACS, LAMMPS, VMD), modeling continuum-level transport and mechanical behavior in COMSOL, and analyzing system-wide performance with Python-driven optimization.Â
